forcats is used to sort the data based on the youngest  to oldest appearance

faceted ranges : each genus as a header, species are on the x axis, saved to a pdf and make the plot large -> 

diversity through time information is stored in the species appearance and disappearance plot

don't need to use tree fucntion to generate the plot
